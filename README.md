## Description

&lt;/Open Source&gt; is your go-to app for your journey to your next tech job career!

&lt;/Open Source&gt; is a MERN stack app that utilizes MongoDB and mongoose for data storage, Node Express for the backend server, and React for front end rendering. &lt;/Open Source&gt; also uses Adzuna's public API on the backend for pulling tech jobs upon the user's query. Lastly, &lt;/Open Source&gt; also has Stripe payment integration for its paid membership feature.

Sign up or log in to begin searching for tech jobs by country, category, and location. The results generated include job title, compay name, URL to the job listing, exact location, job description, and estimated salary. registered users enjoy unlimited query, but only the paid members have access to extra special features that &lt;/Open Source&gt; offers:

- Saving jobs to a user's dashboard
- Sharing jobs via email to other people or themselves
- A personal user dashboard that allows the user to review the jobs they saved, add a progress status and notes to each saved job, and to remove a saved job when the job listing is no longer needed.
- A setting section in the dashboard that allows the user to save and copy updated versions of their resume and cover letter

Becoming a paid member is made easy with Stripe integration, which allows the user to smoothly make a one-time payment and return to the app ready to use the special features.

The Contact page allows any user to send inqueries to Team &lt;/Open Source&gt;

There's also a theme toggler in the footer that allows the user to toggle between color mode and greyscale mode according to their needs, as well as a button for users to easily and smoothly travel back to the top of the page.

&lt;/Open Source&gt; is a PWA, which means it can be seamlessly downloaded from the browser onto the user's local device.
