## Description 
This is an application that allows users to search for tech jobs, save jobs they are interested in, and track their application progress. This is intended to provide users with a centralized platform to browse job openings, save listings that match their interests, and track their application status, making the job search process more streamlined and efficient.


Open Source is deployed on Heroku at: https://open-source.herokuapp.com/

The App's GitHub repo is located at: https://github.com/mshaari/open-source

## Usage
To use the Tech Job Board application, users can simply visit the website, signup, and start searching for tech jobs using keywords and location filters. They can also become a paid member to save job listings they are interested in and track their application progress. Once they have found a job they want to apply for, they can click on the job listing title and be redirected to the job posting on the employer's website.
